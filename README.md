# svelte-piano

A sample-based piano built with Tone.js and Svelte.

This library allows you to easily create a sample instrument and put it on the web. 

I use it as a live interactive demo for [https://vyacheslavbasharov.com/shop/vintage-electric](Vintage Electric)

It supports:
- Playing with a mouse
- Playing MIDI files
- Playing wth a plugged in MIDI keyboard
